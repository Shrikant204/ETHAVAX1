# ETH-AVAX-Function-Errors-Project

It is a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements in Solidity Programming Language

## Description

This Solidity smart contract, named FunctionErrors, demonstrates the use of modifiers and error handling mechanisms in Ethereum smart contracts. It includes functions that showcase the require, assert, and revert statements to handle different types of errors.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., FuncAndError.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile FuncAndError.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "FuncAndError" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "FuncAndError" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the functions available. Finally, press enter to see the output of the functions. When an error occur check the console at the bottom part of the remix to see what were the errors.
